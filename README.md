# HELLO-WORLD
Hello World Project 
My name is Brandi Rogers. My interest in learning this information is primarily because I am homeschooling my son and he is a high school student and I want him to be informed in Computer knowledge. Before I feel confident enough to teach him I want to learn more first. That is the reason I am submitting the commit. I am completing the hello world guide activity.
